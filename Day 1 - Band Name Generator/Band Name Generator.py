# On this day I learned:
# 1. Printing - print text to the console.
# 2. String Manipulation - adding \n, spaces, how to use variables in the print function.
# 3. Inputs - how to input user's data.
# 4. Variables - learned what variables are and how to use them.
# 5. Variable Naming - learned best practices with naming.
# 6. And with all of that knowledge, I've created the Band Name Generator.

print("Hello!\nDo you have struggles naming your band?\nDon't worry, I will help you with that!")
city_name = input("Tell me, where you grew up?\n")
pet_name = input("Tell me the name or the nickname of your pet, please!\n")
print("So, your band name might be: " + city_name + " " + pet_name)
